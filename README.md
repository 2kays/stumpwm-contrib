# A collection of StumpWM modules

In their current state, the modules can be loaded and used via
quicklisp. In the coming weeks load-module.lisp will be reworked in
order to properly load these new subststems. Until then everything in
this repository is fragile and should be considered at best a "Work in
Progress"

TODO: Include a link to the other README.md files under headings
explaining what each module does.
