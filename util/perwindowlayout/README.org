** Usage
Add this to your =.stumpwmrc=:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(load-module "perwindowlayout")
(run-commands "enable-per-window-layout")
#+END_SRC

Then it begins maintaining per-window keyboard layout statuses.

Use the code below to turn it off:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(run-commands "disable-per-window-layout")
#+END_SRC

** Notes
This is in some way specific to Emacs.

** Tasks
*** TODO Try to generalize for other specific applications (other than Emacs)
